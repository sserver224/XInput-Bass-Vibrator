# NOTE:
The included VB-Cable must be installed along with a split audio output program (eg OBS+Audio Monitor). 

To use the included OBS + Audio Monitor for splitting:

1. Desktop Audio Settings Cog > Filters... > Audio Monitor.
2. Name can be anything you want.
3. On the newly created filter, select the VB Cable as your monitor output.

Launch the app. Then, go to Windows Settings then System > Sound > Volume mixer > Bass Vibrator (expand) then select CABLE Output as the input device for that app. Relaunch the app for the settings to take effect.

Note: The audio splitting program must be running for the program to work.
